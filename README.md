# noctua-messenger
This is POC project done for my seminar class at WVSU
The goal of the project is to create a secure peer-to-peer messageing platform using the tor and ethereum network.

# Current progress
1. Local network messaging is function all though messages cant be routed through the tor network right now.
2. Tor server is up and running and is able to serve content through the onion adress.
3. Minimal UI just enough to get messages and view the tor address

# Goals
  - allow for messaging to .onion address
  - make ui more robust add administrative buttons ext
  - develope Ethereum Name service for looking up usernames and integrate with app.
